dev-vm-configs
==============
These files are to be used in conjunction with geerlingguys drupal-dev-vm(https://github.com/geerlingguy/drupal-dev-vm).

Place files located in provisioning into provisioning on the drupal-dev-vm and the drupal.make(todo change to .yml) will replace the one in the vm.

Add the tasks into the vm playbook.
